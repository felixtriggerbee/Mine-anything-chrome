# I turned the web into a mineable world during the Cloudflare outage

So I'm a pretty casual Minecraft player, I've been playing it with my son for a year or so. Today during the global Cloudflare outage, I had literally nothing to do since ALL our services were down, so I vibe coded a Chrome extension that lets you mine elements and stuff on websites.

You hold alt or option + click on any element on a webpage (divs, images, cards, whatever) and it cracks apart with pixelated Minecraft textures. Eventually it disappears.

Here's what I ended up adding:

- **Tool progression** - Start with your hand (slow), work up to Netherite pickaxe. Each tool mines faster.
- **XP system** - Every element you mine gives XP. Ads give 2x. Elements deeper on the page give more XP (up to 5x in the "deep zone" - but it VERY risky).
- **Mobs spawn randomly** - You'll find pets like Allays and Axolotls that give you mining bonuses. Creepers can spawn and explode parts of the page if you don't have a cat to defuse them.
- **Enchantments** - Find enchanted books while mining (Fortune, Efficiency, Looting, etc.) that boost your pickaxe.
- **Diamonds & crafting** - Rare treasure chests drop diamonds. Collect 3 to craft something special.
- **Daily challenges** - Get 3 random challenges each day like "mine 10 ads" or "find a pet" for bonus rewards.

Everything you break resets when you refresh the page, you can toggle mining off and everything you mined reappears. Toggle it back on to keep going.

I honestly don't know why i'm sharing but, it just works really great and since I'm no coder, it's so cool what you can do with AI if you just have a few hours to spare! See the video for how it works!
