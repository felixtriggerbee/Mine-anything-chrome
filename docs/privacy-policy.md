**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

---

## 📌 Privacy at a Glance

**Mine Anything respects your privacy.** This extension operates entirely locally in your browser. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. Your game progress is saved only on your device using Chrome's local storage.

---

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Mine Anything! This Privacy Policy explains how the Mine Anything Chrome extension ("the Extension", "we", "our") handles data and protects your privacy. We are committed to transparency about what data is collected and how it is used.

By installing and using Mine Anything, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

Mine Anything is designed with privacy in mind. The Extension collects and stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

### 2.1 Game Progress Data

- **Experience Points (XP):** Your total XP earned from mining elements
- **Tool Progression:** Your current tool level (Hand, Wooden Axe, Copper Axe, Iron Axe, Golden Axe, Diamond Axe, Netherite Axe)
- **Inventory:** Resources you've collected (coal, iron, gold, redstone, lapis, emerald, diamond, netherite)
- **Crafted Items:** Items you've crafted (torch, redstone lamp, beacon, golden apple, diamond sword)
- **Pet Collection:** Pets you've discovered (Allay, Axolotl, Dennis, Cat, Toad, White Toad) and their counts
- **Enchantments:** Enchantments you've collected and applied to your tools
- **Achievements:** Achievements you've unlocked during gameplay
- **Daily Challenges:** Your current daily challenges and completion status
- **Statistics:** Total elements mined, deep zone mines, and other gameplay statistics

### 2.2 User Preferences

- **Blocked Domains:** List of websites where you've chosen to disable the Extension
- **Settings:** Your custom keybind preferences and other configuration options

### 🔒 Important: All Data is Local

All of the above data is stored exclusively in your browser using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers, third parties, or the extension developer.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The locally stored data is used solely for the following purposes:

- **Game Functionality:** To save and restore your game progress across browser sessions
- **Personalization:** To remember your settings and blocked domains
- **Feature Enhancement:** To track achievements, challenges, and statistics within the game

Your data is never analyzed, shared, sold, or transmitted outside of your local browser environment.

---

## 4. Browser Permissions Explained

Mine Anything requires certain Chrome permissions to function. Here's what each permission is used for:

### 📦 Storage Permission
Required to save your game progress, inventory, achievements, and settings locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`. This data never leaves your device.

### 🖱️ Active Tab Permission
Required to detect when you activate the mining mode on the current webpage. This permission does not track your browsing history or monitor tabs in the background.

### 💉 Scripting Permission
Required to inject the mining mechanics (crack animations, XP collection, mob spawns) into webpages when you activate the extension. Scripts only run on pages where you choose to mine.

### 🌐 Host Permissions (All URLs)
Required to allow the Extension to work on any website you visit. The Extension only activates when you manually enable mining mode (by pressing Alt/Option or clicking the toggle). This permission does not grant access to read, collect, or transmit any webpage content or personal data.

### 🏠 New Tab Override
Optional feature that replaces Chrome's default new tab page with a custom page showing your mining statistics. This can be disabled by uninstalling the extension or changing your Chrome settings.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

### ✅ We Do Not Share Your Data

**Mine Anything does not:**

- Collect any personally identifiable information (PII)
- Track your browsing history or behavior
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Display advertisements or monetize your data
- Access website content beyond visual element manipulation

The Extension operates entirely offline in terms of data handling. There are no backend servers, databases, or external services involved in the operation of Mine Anything.

---

## 6. Data Security

Your game data is protected by Chrome's built-in security mechanisms:

- **Local Storage Only:** Data is stored using Chrome's secure `chrome.storage.local` API, which is isolated per-browser and per-user
- **No Transmission:** Since data never leaves your device, there is no risk of interception during transmission
- **Browser Protection:** Your data is protected by Chrome's sandbox security model, which isolates extensions from each other and from websites
- **No External Dependencies:** The Extension has no external dependencies, reducing the attack surface

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

You have complete control over your data:

### 7.1 Accessing Your Data

You can view your game progress and statistics at any time by:

- Opening the Extension popup (click the extension icon)
- Pressing the 'i' key while mining is active to view your inventory
- Opening Chrome DevTools → Application → Storage → Local Storage

### 7.2 Deleting Your Data

You can delete all your game data at any time by:

- Uninstalling the Extension from `chrome://extensions` (this removes all stored data)
- Clearing browser data for the Extension via Chrome Settings
- Manually clearing `chrome.storage.local` via Chrome DevTools

### 7.3 Blocking Specific Websites

You can prevent the Extension from activating on specific domains by adding them to your blocklist in the Extension popup. This preference is saved locally.

### 7.4 Disabling the Extension

You can temporarily disable Mine Anything at any time via `chrome://extensions` without losing your saved progress.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

Mine Anything does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since the Extension operates entirely locally and does not collect or transmit any personal data, it is safe for users of all ages. However, we recommend parental supervision for young users.

---

## 9. Changes to Website Content

### ⚠️ How the Extension Interacts with Websites

Mine Anything modifies the visual appearance of websites by:

- Adding crack overlay animations to elements you choose to mine
- Temporarily hiding elements that have been "mined"
- Displaying game UI elements (XP notifications, inventory, mob spawns)
- Adding decorative sculk blocks in the "deep zone" (bottom 20% of pages)

**Important:** These changes are purely cosmetic and temporary. They only affect your view of the page and do not alter the actual website code, damage the site, or affect other users. All changes are reversible by toggling the Extension off or refreshing the page.

---

## 10. Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the Extension or legal requirements. When we make changes:

- The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document will be revised
- Significant changes will be communicated through the Extension's update notes
- Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

---

## 11. Open Source Transparency

Mine Anything is an open-source project. The complete source code is available for inspection on GitHub, allowing anyone to verify our privacy claims and see exactly how the Extension works. This transparency ensures accountability and builds trust with our users.
